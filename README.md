## üìä Stakeholder Questions & SQL Solutions

### 1. üßæ Repeat Purchase Behavior of Customers

**Insight:** Repeat buyers account for ~60% of sales and 70% of profit.  
One-time buyers have lower profit margins and churn quickly.

### 2. üöö Shipping Mode Analysis

**Insight:** `Standard Class` shipping has the highest delivery delays.  
`First` and `Second Class` modes yield better margins and timely delivery.

### 3. üí∞ Top 1% Revenue Customers

**Insight:** Top 1% customers contribute ~35% of total revenue.  
They mostly purchase high-value items in `Office Supplies` and `Technology`.

### 4. üìÜ Year-over-Year Sales Performance

**Insight:** Strong YOY growth in early 2000s; sharp declines in 2011  
(e.g., Jan 2011 dropped 67.61% vs Jan 2010).

### 5. üìâ High Volume but Negative Profit Products

**Insight:** Several products with sales > ‚Çπ10,000 still have negative profit margins.  
Action needed to reassess pricing/discount strategy.

### 6. üßÆ Discount Elasticity of Profit

**Insight:** Discounts above 20% lead to steep margin drops (>30%).  
Optimal discount range = 0‚Äì10%.

### 7. üåç Regional Sales Penetration

**Insight:** Regions like **North** and **Central** show high profit-per-customer  
but low total customers ‚Äî opportunity for targeted growth.
